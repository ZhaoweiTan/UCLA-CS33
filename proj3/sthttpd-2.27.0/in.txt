So it turns out the -D(ebugging) flag specifically prevents the 
server from serving as a daemon (background service). Meaning 
thttpd runs in the foreground, "taking over" the shell window as
 long you don't send a Keyboard Interrupt (Ctrl+C).
What this means practically is you need to open up another shell
 window, login to the same SEASNet server, and send your requests 
(through e.g. 'curl' command) to the specific port from there to 
verify that it works.
